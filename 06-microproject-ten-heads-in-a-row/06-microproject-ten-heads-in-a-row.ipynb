    "Simulation is a powerful tool that allows us to run a event with a probabilistic outcome millions of times in under a second.  In this MicroProject, you will use simple simulation to flip a coin a million times and discover how to find trends in the simulated data.  After writing this simulation, you will do analysis that compile data over multiple observation -- a simple form of time-series analysis -- to find if the statistical probability of events measure the simulated probability.\n",
