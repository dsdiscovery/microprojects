Instead of looking at unemployment data, we will be using the DataFrame of home states of University of Illinois students.  *(You already loaded this into a DataFrame in the previous part of this MicroProject, so no need to replace those two lines with anything.)*\n",

    "1. **`data`** attribute -- replace `data=state_data` with a new value for `data`, using the name of the DataFrame you created in Section 2 instead of `state_data`\n",
    "2. **`columns`** attribute -- replace `columns=[\"State\", \"Unemployment\"]` with a new value for `columns`, which should be the column names from the Illinois dataset that includes the state and the total number of students from that state who attends the University of Illinois.\n",
    "3. **`legend_name`** attribute -- replace `legend_name=\"Unemployment Rate (%)\"` with an accurate description of the graph you are creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Change: `key_on`\n",
    "\n",
    "The last item is a bit complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the example, the data identifies each state **by the two letter code** (ex: \"IL\" for \"Illinois\")\n",
    "- In the dataset of students attending the University of Illinois by Permanent Home Address, the data identifies each state **by the whole state name** (ex: \"Illinois\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Section 3**, the `key_on` field maps the data (students attending Illinois) to the geo_data (map of the United States).  You can view this raw data here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-visualization/folium/main/examples/data/us-states.json\n",
    "\n",
    "The geo_data provides the full state name in the data field located at `feature.properties.name` (the letter code is at `feature.id`).  Since we have the full state name, the final change you need to make is to modify the `**key_on**` attribute to be equal to `feature.properties.name`.\n",
